1. 

    X =>  x_l and x_u
    where x_l = (x, l), x_u = x

2.
    Find Centriods:

    for x_l(k) in x_l:
        x_k = sum_i x_l(k, i)
    c_k = x_k
3. 
    Opitization Loops:


    a. Assign labels(Centriods) to unlabeled data according to their distance in the latent space
        for x_? in x_u:
            min = l2_norm(x_?, c_1)
            idx = 1
            for i in [2:k]
                if min > l2_norm(x_2, c_i)
                    idx = i
                    min = l2_norm(x_2, c_i)

    b. Create Similarity sets for labeled data
        x_l => Similarity Set T_l_s and Disimilaritiy T_l_d 

    c. Create Similarity sets for unlabeled data
        x_u => T_u_s and T_u_d

    d. calculate assignment probability(assignment scores)

    e. Centriods relocation 

    f. Gradient Updates according to Loss function:
        L =  L_recon + L_pair_l + L_clus_l + m * (L_pair_u + L_clus_l)
